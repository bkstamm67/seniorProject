# seniorProject

This is my final project at OSU.  My team, who consisted of Andrew Kasnevich, Travis Boaz, and myself, made an iOS 
app for the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition.  The app was to list area businesses which either repaired items or 
would take donated items for reuse.  The app was to display real time changes to the database we created.  I was
responsible for the database design and the web interface to the database.  Travis Boaz created the iOS app and API
interface.
