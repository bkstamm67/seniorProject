# seniorProject

This is my final project at OSU.  My team, consisting of Andrew Kasnevich, Travis Boaz, and myself, made an iOS 
app for the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition.  The app was to list area businesses which either repaired items or 
would take donated items for reuse.  The app was to display real time changes to the database we created.  

I was responsible for the database design and the web interface to the database, which are all located within the 
repos named "database" and "website".  The iOS app and API interface were the responsibility of Travis Boaz, and those
are located in "API" and "app".  Travis can be reached at boazt@oregonstate.edu.
